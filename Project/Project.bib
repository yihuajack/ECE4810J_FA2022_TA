    abstract = {Computer systems research is often inhibited by the availability of memory designs. Existing Process Design Kits (PDKs) frequently lack memory compilers, while expensive commercial solutions only provide memory models with immutable cells, limited configurations, and restrictive licenses. Manually creating memories can be time consuming and tedious and the designs are usually inflexible. This paper introduces OpenRAM, an open-source memory compiler, that provides a platform for the generation, characterization, and verification of fabricable memory designs across various technologies, sizes, and configurations. It enables research in computer architecture, system-on-chip design, memory circuit and device research, and computer-aided design.},
